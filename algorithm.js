/*
You're working with a small bookstore's inventory system. The store has two arrays of data: one for books in stock and one for customer orders. Each book has a title, price, and quantity. Each order has a customer name and the book title they want.
Write a function that takes these two arrays and a book title as parameters. The function should:

1. Check if the book exists in inventory
2. If it exists, check if there's enough quantity to fulfill an order
3. If there's enough quantity, check if there are any pending orders for this book
4. If there are pending orders, fulfill the oldest order first
5. Return an appropriate message for each scenario

Note: Define the algorithm with comments, and then implement each step with code.

const fulfillBookOrder = () => {
